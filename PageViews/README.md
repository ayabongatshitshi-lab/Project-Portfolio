# Page Views Time Series Visualizer

## Project Overview
This project visualises time series data from the freeCodeCamp.org forum. Using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**, I processed daily page view data from 2016 to 2019 to uncover growth patterns and seasonal trends.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Steps
* **Data Cleaning:** Filtered out outliers (top/bottom 2.5%) to ensure statistical accuracy.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Converted raw date strings into datetime objects for precise indexing.
* **Visualisation:** Created a suite of custom plotting functions:
    * **Line Plot:** Tracks daily traffic growth.
    * **Bar Plot:** Compares monthly averages across years.
    * **Box Plots:** Visualises data distribution and seasonal variance.
