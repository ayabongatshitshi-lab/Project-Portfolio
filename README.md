# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to this repository, showcasing some of my self-learning projects across various basic scineitifc computing, data science, and machine learning. 

### Deep Learning & Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* ### [SMS-Spam Classifier](./TextClas)
  **Natural Language Processing:** Implemented a binary text classification model to distinguish between "ham" and "spam" messages using NLP techniques.
* ### [Cat vs. Dog Classifier](./CatsDogs)
  **Computer Vision:** Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing Data Augmentation to improve model generalization.

### Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling
* ### [Book Recommendation Engine](./BookRec)
  **Unsupervised Learning:** Built a recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest books based on user rating patterns.
* ### [Sea Level Analysis](./SeaLevel)
  **Regression & Forecasting:** Utilized Scipy and Linear Regression to analyze historical trends and predict global sea level rise through 2050.

### Data Analysis & Visualization
* ### [Medical Examination Analysis](./MedData)
  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed feature engineering (BMI calculation) and data normalization to visualize correlations between health markers.
* ### [Forum Page View Analysis](./PageViews)
  **Time-Series Visualization:** Analyzed 3+ years of daily traffic data to identify growth trends and seasonal patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
