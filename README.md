## Project Portfolio

Welcome to this repository, showcasing some of my self-learning projects spanning across basic computing, data science, and machine learning. 

1. [Book Recommendation Engine](./Book%20Recommendation%20Engine)
   - **Description:** The project recommends 5 books similar to a given book using K-Nearest Neighbors
   - **Technologies Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (scikit-learn)
   - **Result:** The function returned accurate book recommendations with similarity scores

2. [Cats and Dogs Image Classifier](./Cats-Dogs%20Image%20Classifier)
   - **Description:** The project builds a CNN to classify images of dogs and cats, achieving at least 63% accuracy
   - **Technologies Used:** Convolutional Neural Network (TensorFlow, Keras)
   - **Result:** The model correctly classified test images with 78% accuracy

3. [SMS Text Classifier](./SMS%20Spam%20Classifier)
   - **Description:** The project builds a neural network with text vectorization to classify SMS messages as “ham” or “spam”
   - **Technologies Used:** TextVectorization and deep neural network (TensorFlow, Keras)
   - **Result:** The model accurately predicts message labels on test data with reasonable reliability
