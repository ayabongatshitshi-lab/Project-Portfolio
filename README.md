## Project Portfolio

Welcome to this repository, showcasing some of my self-learning projects spanning across basic computing, data science, and machine learning. 

1. [Book Recommendation Engine](./Book Recommendation Engine)
   **Description:**The project recommends 5 books similar to a given book using K-Nearest Neighbors.
   **Technologies Used:**K-Nearest Neighbors (scikit-learn)
   **Result:**The function returned accurate book recommendations with similarity scores.




### [SMS-Spam Classifier](./TextClas)
  **Natural Language Processing:** Implemented a binary text classification model to distinguish between "ham" and "spam" messages using NLP techniques.
### [Cat vs. Dog Classifier](./CatsDogs)
  **Computer Vision:** Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing Data Augmentation to improve model generalization.
### [Book Recommendation Engine](./BookRec)
  **Unsupervised Learning:** Built a recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest books based on user rating patterns.
### [Sea Level Analysis](./SeaLevel)
  **Regression & Forecasting:** Utilized Scipy and Linear Regression to analyze historical trends and predict global sea level rise through 2050.
### [Medical Examination Analysis](./MedData)
  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed feature engineering (BMI calculation) and data normalization to visualize correlations between health markers.
### [Forum Page View Analysis](./PageViews)
  **Time-Series Visualization:** Analyzed 3+ years of daily traffic data to identify growth trends and seasonal patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
