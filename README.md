## Project Portfolio

Welcome to this repository, showcasing some of my self-learning projects spanning across basic computing, data science, and machine learning. 

1. [Book Recommendation Engine](./Book%20Recommendation%20Engine)
   - **Description:** The project recommends 5 books similar to a given book using K-Nearest Neighbors.
   - **Technologies Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (scikit-learn)
   - **Result:** The function returned accurate book recommendations with similarity scores.

2. [Cats and Dogs Image Classifier](./Cats-Dogs%20Image%20Classifier)
   - **Description:** The project builds a CNN to classify images of dogs and cats, achieving at least 63% accuracy.
   - **Technologies Used:** Convolutional Neural Network (TensorFlow, Keras)
   - **Result:** The model correctly classified test images with ≥63% accuracy.

  


### [SMS-Spam Classifier](./TextClas)
  **Natural Language Processing:** Implemented a binary text classification model to distinguish between "ham" and "spam" messages using NLP techniques.
### [Sea Level Analysis](./SeaLevel)
  **Regression & Forecasting:** Utilized Scipy and Linear Regression to analyze historical trends and predict global sea level rise through 2050.
### [Medical Examination Analysis](./MedData)
  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed feature engineering (BMI calculation) and data normalization to visualize correlations between health markers.
### [Forum Page View Analysis](./PageViews)
  **Time-Series Visualization:** Analyzed 3+ years of daily traffic data to identify growth trends and seasonal patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
